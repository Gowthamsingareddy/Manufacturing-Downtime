# Manufacturing-Downtime Analysis

## Project Overview

A detailed Power BI dashboard analyzing manufacturing downtime for a soda bottling line. This report provides a clear, data-driven look at our operational efficiency and identifies key areas for improvement.

---

## Objectives

ðŸ”¹What's the current line efficiency? (total time / min time)

ðŸ”¹Do any operators struggle with particular types of operator error?

ðŸ”¹Are any operators underperforming?

ðŸ”¹What are the leading factors for downtime?.

---

### Project Highlights

ðŸ”¹ End-to-end solution integrating database management, data cleaning, and dashboarding

ðŸ”¹ Power BI for interactive dashboard visualizations with filters and drill-throughs

## Key Insights

ðŸ”¹The overall production efficiency is 64%.

ðŸ”¹Leading Downtime Factors: The primary causes of downtime are not operator errors, but rather issues with the machinery. The top two factors are machine failure (254 minutes) and inventory shortage (225 minutes). This suggests a need to focus on maintenance and supply chain management.

ðŸ”¹Machine Adjustment, Machine Failure, Inventory Shortage, Batch Change, and Batch Coding Error together account for 80% of the total downtime.

ðŸ”¹Machine Adjustment downtime is the highest at 332 mins, and this factor affects all operators.

ðŸ”¹The product CO-600 recorded the highest extra downtime at 494 mins.

ðŸ”¹Monday had the maximum extra downtime with 503 mins, while Tuesday had the lowest with 32 mins.

ðŸ”¹Among operators, Charlie had the highest efficiency at 66.84%, and Mac had the lowest at 60.94%.

## Objectives

ðŸ”¹Since Machine Adjustment is the largest downtime cause and is operator-driven, provide structured training for all operators on machine setup, calibration, and adjustment procedures.

ðŸ”¹Machine Failure requires a preventive maintenance program with regular inspections to minimize breakdowns.

ðŸ”¹Inventory Shortage is a major downtime factor. Improve supply tracking, keep extra stock as backup, and plan material needs better so that production doesnâ€™t stop.

ðŸ”¹Batch Change and Batch Coding Errors indicate skill gaps. Provide refresher training to all operators, with special focus on Mac (lowest efficiency at 60.94%) for batch change procedures.

ðŸ”¹Since CO-600 product has the highest downtime, investigate its process flow, machine settings, or quality checks to identify bottlenecks.

ðŸ”¹Monday shows the maximum downtime (503 mins) compared to other days. Review shift planning, workload distribution, and machine availability on Mondays to balance performance across the week.
